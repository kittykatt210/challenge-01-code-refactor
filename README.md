# challenge-01-code-refactor

## Description

This project contains the Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge that consists of HTML and CSS refactoring, and Github usage. My motivation for this project is to work on my web design skills and usage of github. I built this project to become more proficient in using semantic HTML elements as well as using github as a repository for my work. This project aimed to create an HTML file that follows accessibility standards. I learned that there are various semantic HTML elements that help the flow of the document. I also learned that while it is important to include alt text with images, it is important to include descriptive text when using icons for accessibility purposes. Finally, I am learning that I am feeling more comfortable using github and repositories for my projects.
